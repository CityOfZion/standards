 # Contributing
 
 To contribute to City of Zion and be eligible for weekly awards, you must follow these steps:
 
 1.  Join the City of Zion slack channel [here]()
 2. Work with the teams to improve the various City of Zion and Neo Projects by using the standard git-flow workflow.  Projects can be technical (like neon wallet) or non-technical (documentation). The only requirement is that the projects must be MIT liscensed 
 3. Every week, an `@channel` will be made in the `_contribution_gists` channel.  
 <b>You must create a github gist for the week and post it in the `_contribution_gists` channel upon seeing this alert.</b>
 
 4. As verification that the gist was been received, an emoji will be added to the gist by someone from CoZ council. This process may take a few days so be patient.
 5. CoZ council will vote on the week's contributions and distribute awards to the community as thanks.  This may take 1-2 weeks from when your gist was posted.
